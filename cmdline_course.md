Command-line course

Introduction

You should write a short overall introduction to the course and one section for every week (for the final week, you can talk about Jekyll and Gihub Pages). Please use appropriate headers for each section. You should briefly describe the main content of each week and also briefly reflect on what you learned during the week (maybe 1-3 sentences for reflection). You need to include at least one list, image and table on the cmdline_course page. 

Read about formatting code in markdown. Every section should include some formatted example code or commands like:



%.freq: %.no_md.txt
    bin/freqlist.sh $< $@
Please explain how the code relates to the theme of the week (for example: This is a make rule which has a target %.freq and dependency %.no_md.txt). You can use syntax highlighting but we don't require it (it's possible that some of the jekyll themes actually don't support highlighting).
